This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for my MSc project in Data Science, titled "Improving Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for Theme Identification in Specialized Domains: A Comparative Investigation of Preprocessing Approaches and Hyperparameter Settings."

The goal of this project was to enhance LDA topic modeling by optimizing preprocessing techniques and fine-tuning hyperparameters for accurate and meaningful categorization of text samples across specialized fields, including medicine, law, technology, and more.

Features
Implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal).
Development and training of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models for topic categorization.
Evaluation of the modelâ€™s performance using coherence scores and accuracy metrics.
Comparative analysis of different preprocessing approaches and their impact on LDA outcomes.
Application of the model to real-world datasets in domains like:
Medicine
Law
Engineering
Business and Finance
IT and more.
